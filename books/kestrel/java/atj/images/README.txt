The "sources" of the images are the PowerPoint (.pptx) files. The actual image
(.png) files are obtained as follows. Each file consists of a single slide,
whose area of interest is delimited by a dashed rectangle. Take (something like)
a screenshot of the area just inside the dashed rectangle, and resize it to 800
pixels wide, preserving the width/height ratio of the image. Save the result in
PNG format.
