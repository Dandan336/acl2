This directory is based on the dissertation work completed by Jun
Sawada at the University of Texas at Austin.  For an overview,

Jun Sawada completed this work in 1998 and 1999.  Matt Kaufmann made
updates in October, 2024, so that the books would certify with the
latest ACL2.  Each such update is marked with a "Matt K. mod" comment.
None of the original events used skip-proofs; Matt used skip-proofs on
three defthm events that were no longer proved by ACL2 some 25 years
later, either due to ACL2 changes or due to library changes.  Anyone
is welcome to figure out how to remove them!
