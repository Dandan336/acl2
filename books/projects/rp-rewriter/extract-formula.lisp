 "<p>Users can use 
the functions below to register rules to RP-Rewriter's
 ruleset:</p>

<code> 
@('(rp::add-rp-rule <rule-name> 
                 &key (disabled 'nil)
                      (beta-reduce 'nil)
                      (hints 'nil))')
</code>
 <p>This macro submits a table event that saves the given rule in the
 ruleset. The time you use submit this event will affect the priority the rule
 will have. If you choose to add the rule as disabled, you may use the
 corresponding key. </p>
<p> The beta-reduce key checks the RHS of the rule to see if it is a lambda
expression. If that is the case, then it calls @(see rp::defthm-lambda) to
create a new rule and save that instead. The name of the new rule will be
printed, and it will be disabled for ACL2. You need to use that new name while
enabling/disabling the added rule for RP-Rewriter. The hints key is only relevant when
defthm-lambda is called. </p>


<code> @('(rp::def-rp-rule <rule-name> <conjecture> <optional-hints> ...)') </code>
This macro has the
 same signature as defthm. It submits a @(see rp::defthm-lambda) event in case
RHS has a lambda expression. If it doesn't then defthm-lambda translates to defthm. It also submits a
 add-rp-rule event to save the rule in the rule-set. 

<code>
@('(rp::enable-rules <rules>)')
</code>
This macro submits an event to enable a list of
 rules from the given list.

<code> 
@('(rp::disable-rules <rules>)')
</code>
 The opposite of rp::enable-rules.


<code>@('(rp::disable-all-rules)')</code>

This submits an event and disables all the rewrite rules. 

<code> @('(rp::disable-exc-counterpart <fnc-name>)') </code> The executable
 counterparts are enabled by default for all functions and they belong to a
 different rule-set for rp-rewriter. This macro submits an event to disable the
 executable counterpart of given function.

 <code> @('(rp::enable-exc-counterpart <fnc-name>)') </code>
 The opposite of rp::disable-exc-counterpart.
