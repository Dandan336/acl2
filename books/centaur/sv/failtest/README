                          SV + VL Failure Tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains various test cases that VL+SV should fail to
"successfully" translate.  Many of these tests were originally part of the
VL2014 failtests directory, which had the same goal, and we adopt the same
conventions here.

Each test here should define a parameter-free module named "top" that has a
problem (or that instantiates a module that has a problem).

The Makefile tries to translate each file, in isolation, using the VL/SV flow,
in both Verilog and SystemVerilog modes.  We try to ensure that the top module
was not successfully translated, by which we mean: either the translation fails
completely in some spectacular way, or we at least get a fatal warning in the
top module.
