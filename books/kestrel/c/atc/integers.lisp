     When the exact result of an aritmetic operation on signed integers
     is not representable in the signed integer type,
     the behavior is undefined [C:6.5/5]:
     our functions for signed integer operations
     have guards requiring the results to be representable.
     For division and remainder,
     the guard also requires the divisor to be non-zero.
     The bitwise operations assume a two's complement representation;
     these operations depend on the representation of integers [C:6.5/4]."))
