Certification of books in this directory depends on the following.

cp -p ../apply.lisp evaluation-apply.lisp
cp -p user-defs.lisp evaluation-user-defs.lisp

That is done automatically using "make", or by running a regression
from the top-level ACL2 directory or books/.

Running "make" in this directory, however, will not guarantee that the
books in the parent directory are certified, which is necessary.
Either run make in the parent directory or run cert.pl with option
--include-excludes in either directory _after_ copying as shown above.
