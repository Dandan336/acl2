; When the following was on one line, there was a report of "Bad path" in the
; runs/ directory during a regression attempt.  For that reason I added
; linebreaks below (after ld and also before :dir) at one point.  But then some
; dependencies were missing.  The "bad path" message seemed to be gone, but
; Eric Smith pointed out how it can happen -- namely, when runs/ doesn't exist.
; So I've put the linebreaks back in, and I'll add the necessary dependencies
; via a multi-line comment below.

; See above for an explanation of the following comment, which is intended to
; support dependency tracking.  It is based on the include-book forms near the
; top of books/kestrel/acl2data/gather/patch-book.lisp, including the one at
; the end for "my-advice" that's commented out there.
