(in-package "ACL2")

;; STATUS: In-progress

;; An ACL2 "lint" tool.  This applies some checks to all functions currently
;; defined in the world.  It currently checks for calls of CW with missing
;; arguments and calls of IF with resolvable tests.

;; Usage: Include the linter first, then the books to be checked.  Then call
;; (run-linter).  Use option :check :all to check the linter itself, any books
;; included before the linter, and the ACL2 system.  Otherwise, such things are
;; not checked.

;; The linter detects:
;;
;; - Uses of format strings where too few or too many values are given.  The
;; former is almost certainly an error.  The latter may indicate an error.
;;
;; - Uses of context arguments (quoted symbols) passed to things like
;; hard-error that may be wrong (e.g., copied and pasted from another function).
;;
;; - Explicit :guard-debug xargs, presumably left behind after debugging.
;; Leaving :guard-debug t can probably slow down guard proofs.
;;
;; - Equality tests (calls EQ, EQL, or =) that seem to be ill-guarded (e.g.,
;; calling EQ on things that are known to be non-symbols).
;;
;; - Equality tests (calls of EQUAL or EQL) that could be optimized to faster,
;; more specific, tests.
;;
;; - Ground terms in functions that could perhaps be computed ahead of time.
;;
;; - Calls of IF where the test is provably always nil or always non-nil.
;;
;; - Calls of IF where both branches are the same.

;; NOTE: There is another lint tool in books/tools/lint.lisp.  It checks for
;; different things.

;; TODO: Check for a hyp of (syntaxp (quote x)), which is almost certainly an error.

;; TODO: Look for theorem names of the form theorem-for-XXX from make-flag

;; TODO: Look for hyps and guard conjuncts that are known true or false by type-set.

;; TODO: Print terms (such as if-tests) as untranslated terms somehow?

;; TODO: Detect a LET above an IF that is used in only 1 branch

;; TODO: Detect a LET* that could simply be a LET.

;; TODO: Detect a B* that could simply be a  let OF LET* (maybe)

;; TODO: Add option to diable checking for the acl2 system itself.

;; TODO: Add support for supressing more kinds of reports.

;; TODO: Suppress reasoning-based checks (like those involving types) on :program mode functions.
