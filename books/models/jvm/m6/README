This directory is based on the dissertation work completed by Hanbing
Liu at the University of Texas at Austin.  It is based on the src/
subdirectory created by executing the following command:

git clone https://github.com/haliu/M6

Specifically, Matt Kaufmann executed that command on 10/1/2024, which
came with the following log.

~/temp/hbl/M6$ git log
commit bc8eb609089abcee054704530c8f84fde70aae8e (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)
Author: haliu <hanbing.liu@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Oct 10 13:28:53 2015 -0500

    Initial import Hanbing's dissertation work under git
~/temp/hbl/M6$ 

Files *.lisp.html were then deleted here.

The README file from that distribution is file README-M6 in the
directory of this README (except for the first line of README-M6,
which was added by Matt).

Hanbing points out the following.

- The "small" subdirectory contains a self-contained proof that a byte
  verified program will never overflow the operand stack in a "small"
  JVM like machine.

- Then "main" directory contains an incomplete proof (i.e. with
  skip-proofs) that bytecode verified program when executed on a JVM
  will match the execution on a "defensive JVM".

Matt made a number of tweaks in order to get the books to certify with
the current ACL2.  Other than deleting stray right parentheses, these
are all labeled with "Matt K.".
