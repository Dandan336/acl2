# This file is intended to mimic what happens when someone who doesn't have glucose does a build (in case that build wrongly calls glucose):

echo "ERROR: Glucose is being run, but we have been told to have such an attempt cause an error."

# Return an error code so that when books/build/features.sh calls glucose it gets an error:
exit 1
