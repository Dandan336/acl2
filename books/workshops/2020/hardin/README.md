Simple stack data type implemented using Restricted Algorithmic (RAC), and automatically 
translated to ACL2, at which point functional correctness proofs can be performed.

Creation of the ACL2 code from the RAC sources requires that RAC tools are built and installed.
See projects/rac in the ACL2 books directory for more information on RAC.
