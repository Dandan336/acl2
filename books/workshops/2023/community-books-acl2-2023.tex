% ORDER OF THE SLIDES AND ENTRIES
% -------------------------------

% First all the new libraries, in alphabetical order.

% Then all the improved libraries, in alphabetical order.

% Then one or more slides with additional contributions.

% Don't worry about adding your contributions in order:
% Alessandro will quickly put them in order if needed,
% and also fix any formatting issues.

% TITLE SLIDE
% -----------

% Add your name as co-author, in alphabetical order of last name.

% Add your organization, in alphabetical order.
% Renumber the \inst{n} instances as needed
% (both inside \author{...} and inside \institute{...}).

% Or ask Alessandro to do this.

% OTHER REMARKS
% -------------

% Use the \code{...} macro for code (i.e.\ fixed-width) font within the text.

% If you want to show code block snippets,
% use the verbatim environment,
% and add [fragile] just after \begin{frame}.

% For guidelines on content and level of detail,
% please see existing entries.
% The goal is to provide enough information to get possible users interested.
