----------------------------------------------------------------------

gcd.lisp: a circuit, gcd, computing the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
of two natural numbers.

gcd-alg.lisp: the correctness proof of the GCD algorithm.

comp-gcd-cond.lisp: a circuit, C, performing the GCD condition. It
contains Q2 and Q3 as submodules.

comp-gcd.lisp: a GCD circuit, c-gcd, that contains C as a submodule.

comp-gcd-body.lisp: a circuit, comp-gcd-body, performing the GCD
operation in one iteration.  It is constructed using the self-timed
serial subtractor serial-sub.

comp-gcd2.lisp: a GCD circuit, c-gcd2, that contains comp-gcd-body as
a submodule.

q3-gcd.lisp: a GCD circuit, q3-gcd, that concatenates Q3 and gcd.

q3-comp-gcd.lisp: a GCD circuit, q3-c-gcd, that concatenates Q3 and
c-gcd.
