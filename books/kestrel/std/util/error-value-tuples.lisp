     "An <i>error-value tuple</i> is a list consisting of
      an <i>error component</i> @('erp')
      followed by
      zero or more <i>value components</i> @('val1'), ..., @('valN'),
      where @('N') &ge; 0.
      An ACL2 function can return an error-value tuple
      to indicate possible errors:
      if no error occurs,
      @('erp') is @('nil')
      and @('val1'), ..., @('valN') are the normal results of the function;
      if an error occurs,
      @('erp') contains non-@('nil') information about the error
      and @('val1'), ..., @('valN') contain irrelevant values.")

    (xdoc::p
     "There is no strict requirements on the type of @('erp'),
      but it should be, or include, an optional "
     (xdoc::seetopic "msg" "message")

      for instance, an error could be a @(tsee cons) pair
      whose @(tsee car) is a machine-oriented error code or structure,
      and whose @(tsee cdr) is a human-readable message.
      When writing code in a statically strongly typed style,
      particularly using @(tsee define) with argument and result types
      (the latter in @(':returns')),
      it may be better to leave @('erp') untyped for future extensibility,
      while @('val1'), ..., @('valN') should have types
      that make sense when no error occurs.
      If a type for @('erp') is used, e.g. @(tsee maybe-msgp),
      it should be the same for all the functions that call each other,
      so that the same type of errors can be propagated (see below).")

       When a hard error occurs,
       it print a message to ACL2's error output,
       and it stops execution.
       A hard error is automatically propagated
       through the callers up the stack.
       However, a hard error cannot be caught: it always stops execution.")

     (xdoc::p
      "Since logically a hard error returns @('nil'),
       when a function returns a hard error,
       unless it has one result whose type includes @('nil'),
       one must add code to return an appropriate number and type of results,
       in order to maintain a statically strongly typed style.
       This is equivalent in effort to writing the @('reterr') binder,
       and the hard error call, which contains just a message,
       is equivalent in effort to writing a @('reterr') call with the message.
       Hard error propagation is fully automatic,
       but writing the @('erp') binder is equivalent in effort
       to writing an @('mv') or a single-variable binder
       for a call of a function that may return a hard error
       (such a function needs not return an error result).
       Thus, all in all, using error-value tuples,
       with the utilities provided here,
       takes about the same amount of code as using hard errors,
       with the advantage that errors can be potentially caught,
       which is useful for using tools programmatically besides interactively.
       The only extra effort required for error-value tuples is that,
       if the error is not caught,
       there must be some code, near the top level,
       to actually print the message on the screen,
       perhaps using a hard or soft error."))

       needs to throw soft errors,

       This aggregation is slightly inconvenient,
       especially when writing code in a statically strongly typed style,
       in which every argument and result has a clear type.
       A possible aggregation is a tuple (i.e. list),
