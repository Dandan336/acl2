This directory contains a version of apply$ built in an isolated package named "MODAPP" (for Model of Apply$).

In addition, it contains two subdirectories, ex1/ and ex2/ that illustrate the modeling technique for a small set of
mapping functions and a large set, respectively.

In addition it contains report.lisp which contains the example functions and
theorems cited in the Examples section of the paper (in preparation)
"Limited Second Order Functionality in a First Order Setting."

See also the end of ACL2 source file apply-raw.lisp for a related
essay, "Essay on Admitting a Model for Apply$ and the Functions that
Use It".
