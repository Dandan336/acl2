Supporting materials should go into directories named after
authors of accepted papers.  Typically, they go into a support/
subdirectory of each such directory; see past directories
books/workshops/20??/ for examples.

Note: If you are not a frequent contributor to the community books,
you will likely be using pull requests if you contribute books using
git.  See :doc git-quick-start, e.g.:
