     the limit is the same as the `then' branch.
     Otherwise, we generate an @('if') statement

     the test expression is generated from the test term;
     we ensure that the two branches have the same type
     (if @('affect') is non-@('nil'), those types are both @('nil')).
     When we process the branches,
     we extend the symbol table with a new empty scope for each branch.
     The calculation of the limit result is a bit more complicated in this case:
     we need 1 to go from @(tsee exec-block-item-list)
     to @(tsee exec-block-item),
     another 1 to go from that to @(tsee exec-stmt),
     and another 1 to go to the @(':ifelse') case there;
     the test is pure and so it needs no addition to the limit;
     since either branch may be taken,
     we return the sum of the limits for the two branches.
     More precisely, the limit recursively returned for each branch
     pertains to the block item list in the branch,
     but those are put into a compound statement;
     thus, we need to increase the recursively calculated limit
     by 1 to go from @(tsee exec-block-item-list) to @(tsee exec-block-item),
     and another 1 to go from there to @(tsee exec-stmt).
     In principle we could return the maximum from the two branches
     instead of their sum,
     but we want the limits to be
     linear combinations of sub-limits,
     so that ACL2's linear arithmetic can handle the reasoning about limits
     during the generated proofs.")

     a statement term affecting the bound variables,
     generating block items for it;
     then we continue processing the body of the @(tsee mv-let)
     as a term affecting the variables in @('affect').
     We use the sum of the two limits as the overall limit:
     thus, after @(tsee exec-block-item-list) executes
     the block items for the bound term,
     it still has enough limit to executed the block items for the body term.")
   (xdoc::p
    "If the term is a @(tsee let), there are four cases.
     If the binding has the form of an array write,
     and if the @(':experimental') input to ATC allows array writes,
     we generate an array assignment;
     before this feature can be turned from experimental to fully supported,
     we may need to perform some additional checks here.
     Otherwise, if the term involves the @(tsee declar) wrapper,
     we ensure that a variable with the same symbol name is not already in scope
     (i.e. in the symbol table)
     and that the name is a portable ASCII identifier;
     we generate a declaration for the variable,
     initialized with the expression obtained
     from the term that the variable is bound to,
     which also determines the type of the variable;
     the type must not be a pointer type (code generation fails if it is).
     Otherwise, if the term involves the @(tsee assign) wrapper,
     we ensure that the variable is assignable,
     which implies that it must be in scope,
     and we also ensure that it has the same type as the one in scope;
     we generate an assignment whose right-hand side is
     obtained from the unwrapped term,
     which must be an expression term returning a C value.
     Otherwise, if the term involves no wrapper,
     we also ensure that the variable is assignable,
     and that the non-wrapped term represents a conditional of loop in C;
     we generate code that affects the variable from that term.
     In all cases, we recursively generate the block items for the body
     and we put those just after the preceding code.")
   (xdoc::p
    "In the @(tsee let) case whose translation is explained above,
     the limit is calculated as follows.
     For the case of an array write, the limit is irrelevant for now;
     we do not generate proofs for array writes.
     For the case of the term representing code that affects variables,
     we add up the two limits,
     similarly to the @(tsee mv-let) case.
     For the other cases, we have one block item followed by block items.
     First, we need 1 to go from @(tsee exec-block-item-list)
     to @(tsee exec-block-item).
     Then we take the sum of the limit for the first block item
     and the limit for the remaining block items
     (in principle we could take the maximum,
     but see the discussion above for @(tsee if)
     for why we take the sum instead).
     The first block item is either a declaration or an assignment.
     If it is a declaration, we need 1 to go from @(tsee exec-block-item)
     to the @(':declon') case and to @(tsee exec-expr-call-or-pure).
     If it is an assignment, we need 1 to go from @(tsee exec-block-item)
     to the @(':stmt') case and to @(tsee exec-stmt),
     another 1 to go from there to the @(':expr') case
     and to @(tsee exec-expr-asg),
     and another 1 to go from there to @(tsee exec-expr-call-or-pure),
     for which we recursively get the limit.
     For the remaining block items, we need to add another 1
     to go from @(tsee exec-block-item-list) to its recursive call.")

     We also retrieve the associated limit term,
     which, as explained in @(tsee atc-fn-info),
     suffices to execute @(tsee exec-stmt-while).
     But here we are executing lists of block items,
     so we need to add 1 to go from @(tsee exec-block-item-list)

     For now we do not check the remaining arguments:
     we simply ignore them.
     Indeed, no code needs to be generated for them,
     because their returning just represents side effects
     which are implicit in the C code,
     in the same way as other affected variables.
     Before making array write support non-experimental,
     we will carefully check these arguments, along with other constraints.")

     then the term is illegal:
     any term affecting one or more variables must end with
     the one variable or with an @(tsee mv) of the two or more variables.
     If @('affect') is @('nil'),
     we translate the term to an expression

     the variables affected by the loop.

     to execute @(tsee exec-stmt-while) on (the test and body of)
     the loop statement, as follows.
     We need 1 to get to executing the test,
     which is pure and so does not contribute to the overall limit.
     If the test is true, we need to add the limit to execute the body.
     After that, @(tsee exec-stmt-while) is called recursively,
     decrementing the limit:
     given that we know that the loop function terminates,
     its measure must suffice as the limit.
     The loop function decreases the measure by at least 1 (maybe more)
     at every recursive call, so the limit does not decrease any faster,
     and we will never run out of the limit before the measure runs out.
     Thus the measure is an over-approximation for the limit, which is sound.
     We also note that the measure refers to the initial call of the function,
     while here it would suffice
     to take the measure at the first recursive call,
     but taking the whole measure is simpler,
     and again it is sound to over-appoximate.
     Note that we use the measure function for @('fn')
     that is generated by ATC,
     for the reasons explained in @(tsee atc-gen-measure-of-fn).
     Besides the @('limit-all') result,
     which is the limit for the whole loop,
     we also return @('limit-body'), which is just for the loop body;
     this is in support for more modular proofs. "))

     the formals of @('fn'),
     the computation state @('compst'),
     the function environment for the translation unit,
     and a suitably large limit (more on this below).
     In this generated theorem,
     the first result of @(tsee exec-fun) is equated to
     a call of @('fn') on its formals,
     while the second result of @(tsee exec-fun) is equated to @('compst').
     Currently function calls have no persistent effect on the state
     in the C code generated by ATC:
     this is why the final state is the same as the initial one.
     This will change in the future,
     and this theorem will be suitably generalized.
     The guard of @('fn') is used as hypothesis,
     along with the fact that @('compst') is a computation state.")

    "We use a variable for the function environment,
     which we equate to the translation unit's function environment
     in a hypothesis.
     Note that, when we execute the ACL2 code in this function,
     we do not have the function environment
     of the generated translation unit yet,
     because we generate these correctness theorems
     along with the function definitions that form the translation unit
     (currently we could generate these theorems after the translation unit,
     but we prefer to do them at the same time for easier future extensions,
     in which we may generate ``smaller'' theorems,
     possibly for subterms/subexpressions/substatements).
     Thus, we cannot use a quoted constant for the function environment here.
     The reason why we introduce a variable and equate it in the hypothesis,
     as opposed to using @('(init-fun-env <program>)')
     directly as argument of @(tsee exec-fun),
     is that we want to use this theorem as a rewrite rule
     in the theorem generated by @(tsee atc-gen-fn-correct-thm),
     and using a variable makes the rule easier to match with,
     in particular if @(tsee init-fun-env) needs to be enabled.")

     which is assumed (in a hypothesis of the generated theorem)

   (xdoc::p
    "The proof is a symbolic execution of the generated translation unit,
     which is a constant: see @(see atc-proof-support).
     The proof is carried out in the theory that consists of
     exactly the general rules listed there,
     plus the definition of @('fn') (clearly),
     plus the theorems that the functions callable by @('fn') return values,
     plust the type prescriptions of the functions callable by @('fn'),
     plus the correctness theorems of the functions callable by @('fn').
     During symbolic execution, the initial limit for @('fn')
     is progressively decremented,
     so by the time we get to functions called by @('fn')
     it will have different symbolic values from the initial variable;
     thus, we need to match that to the variable @('limit')
     in the correctness theorems for the callees,
     which are used as rewrite rules to turn calls of @(tsee exec-fun)
     into calls of the corresponding ACL2 functions.
     These will thus match the calls in the definition of @('fn'),
     and the called functions can stay disabled in the proof.
     The theorems about the callable functions returning values
     are needed to exclude, in the proof, the case that
     these functions return errors.
     The type prescriptions of the callable functions
     are needed to discharge some proof subgoal that arise.")
   (xdoc::p
    "Furthermore, we generate a @(':use') hint
     to augment the theorem's formula with the guard theorem of @('fn'),
     with the pointer arguments replaced by the dereferenced arrays.
     This is critical to ensure that the symbolic execution of the C operators
     does not split on the error cases:
     the fact that @('fn') is guard-verified
     ensures that @(tsee add-sint-sint) and similar functions are always called
     on values such that the exact result fit into the type,
     which is the same condition under which the dynamic semantics

    "We generate the correctness theorem as a lemma first,
     then the actual theorem.
     The only difference between the two is that
     the lemma uses the specialization of @(tsee exec-stmt-while)
     that is generated as discussed above,
     while the theorem uses the general @(tsee exec-stmt-while);
     the reason is so we can have the right induction, as discussed above.
     As explained shortly,
     the formula involves (some of) the loop function's formals,
     so we take those into account to generate variables for
     the computation state, the function environment, and the limit.
     The hypotheses include the guard of the loop function,
     but we need to replace any pointers with their dereferenced arrays
     (see @(tsee atc-gen-fn-correct-thm)),
     and in addition,
     as discussed in @(tsee atc-gen-term-with-read-var-compustate),
     we need to replace the parameters of the loop function
     with @(tsee read-var) calls that read the corresponding variables.
     The other hypotheses are the same as in @(tsee atc-gen-fn-correct-thm),
     with the addition of a hypothesis that
     the number of frames in the computation state is not zero;
     this is always the case when executing a loop.
     The arguments of the loop function call are obtained by
     replacing its formals with the corresponding @(tsee read-var) calls.
     The lemma is proved via proof builder instructions,
     by first applying induction
     and then calling the prover on all the induction subgoals.
     For robustness, first we set the theory to contain
     just the specialized @(tsee exec-stmt-while),
     then we apply induction, which therefore must be on that function.
     The hints for the subgoals are for the symbolic execution,
     similar to the ones in @(tsee atc-gen-fn-correct-thm),
     where the @(':expand') hint applies to the loop function,
     for robustness (as ACL2's heuristics sometimes prevent
     the opening of recursive function definitions,
     but here we know that we always want to open it).
     The hints also include:
     (i) the return value theorem of the loop function,
     which is reasonable since the function is recursive,
     and so it is called inside its body;
     (ii) the definition of the specialized @(tsee exec-stmt-while);
     (iii) the rule saying that the measure yields a natural number; and
     (iv) the termination theorem of the loop function, suitably instantiated.
     We also pass the theorem asserting the correctness of the loop body:
     this is expected to be used as a rewrite rule for the body,
     making its symbolic execution unnecessary here;
     this is a step towards more modular and controlled proofs.
     Given the correctness lemma, the correctness theorem is easily proved,
     via the lemma and the generate theorem that equates
     the specialized @(tsee exec-stmt-while) to the general one."))
