    "Some of the rules that are used in the symbolic execution
     rewrite calls of functions used in the deeply embedded dynamic semantics
     into their shallowly embedded counterparts,
     under hypothesis on the types of the arguments.
     For instance, @('(exec-unary op x)')
     is rewritten to @('(<op>-<type> x)')
     when @('op') is @('<op>')
     and @('x') has type @('<type>').
     These shallowly embedded counterparts are used
     in the ACL2 functions from which C code is represented:
     thus, the rewrite rules serve to turn (the execution of) the C code
     into the ACL2 terms from which the C code is generated,
     which is at the core of proving the correctness of the generated C code.")
   (xdoc::p
    "For recursive ACL2 functions that model C execution
     (e.g. @(tsee exec-expr-pure)),
     we introduce opener rules,
     which include @(tsee syntaxp) hypotheses requiring that
     the C abstract syntax being executed is a quoted constant.
     Some of these opener rules include binding hypotheses,
     which avoid symbolically executing the same pieces of C abstract syntax
     multiple times in some situations.")
   (xdoc::p
    "We collect the rules in lists,
     each of which serves a particular symbolic execution purpose.
     Certain rules (proved elsewhere) may appear in multiple lists,
     when they serve multiple symbolic execution purposes."))
