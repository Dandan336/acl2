<h3>Todo/Wishlist</h3>


<p>The current design is sort of snapshot-oriented.  David suggested a
more history-oriented focus where you could see the previous goals and
how things changed.  I think that could work much better.  (It should
be quite easy to switch over to that sort of a model)</p>

<ul>
<li>Buttons to take actions like sr, bash, etc.</li>
<li>Integrate show rules, show linear, etc., options for which rule to use</li>
<li>Automatic counterexample generation attempts to point out false goals.</li>
<li>Diveable terms</li>
<li>Goal management -- current goal instead of just current term, highlight
current term within the goal, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs</h3>

<p><tt>split</tt> doesn't work in ACL2(h) due to memoize being unthreadsafe for
whatever reason.  Currently we avoid this using <tt>pro</tt> instead.</p>
