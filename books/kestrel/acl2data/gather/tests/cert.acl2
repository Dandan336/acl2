; When the following was on one line, there was a report of "Bad path" in the
; runs/ directory during a regression attempt.  For that reason I added
; linebreaks below (after ld and also before :dir) at one point.  But then some
; dependencies were missing.  Now the "bad path" message seems to be gone, so
; I've removed the linebreaks (10/31/2024).  If "bad path" happens again, a
; solution could be to add a multi-line comment with the include-book forms
; near the top of books/kestrel/acl2data/gather/patch-book.lisp, including the
; one at the end for "my-advice" that's commented out there.
