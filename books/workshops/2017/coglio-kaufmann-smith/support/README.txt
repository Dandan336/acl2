NOTE: As discussed in ../README, support for the current version of
the simplify tool (which supersedes simplify-defun) may be found in
community books directory books/kestrel/apt/.

Supporting file for Section 2.1:

  example-producer-consumer.lisp

Supporting file for Section 2.2:

  example-integers.lisp

The remaining files support the definition of simplify-defun.  To play
with simplify-defun, evaluate the forms in simplify-defun-tests.lisp.
