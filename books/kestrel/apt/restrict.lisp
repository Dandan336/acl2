   Following the design notes,

  "<p>
   As mentioned in @(tsee restrict-new-fn-intro-events),
   the verification of the guards of the new function,
   when it has to take place,
   is deferred when the function is introduced.
   The reason is that, as shown in the design notes,
   the guard verification proof for the recursive case
   uses the theorem that relates the old and new functions:
   thus, the theorem must be proved before guard verification,
   and the new function must be introduced before proving the theorem.
   In the non-recursive case, we could avoid deferring guard verification,
   but we defer it anyhow for uniformity.
   </p>
   <p>
   Following the design notes, the guards are verified
   using the guard theorem of the old function
   and the @('restriction-guard') applicability condition.
   This suffices for the non-recursive case (in the empty theory).
   For the recursive case,
   we also use the @('restriction-of-rec-calls') applicability condition,
   and we carry out the proof in the theory consisting of
   the theorem that relates the old and new functions:
   this theorem rewrites all the recursive calls of the old function,
   in the old function's guard theorem,
   to corresponding recursive calls of the new function
   (the design notes cover the representative case of a single recursive call,
   but the transformation covers functions with multiple recursive calls).
   </p>
   <p>
   The guard verification event
   is local to the @(tsee encapsulate) generated by the transformation.
   This keeps the event history after the transformation &ldquo;clean&rdquo;,
   without implementation-specific proof hints
   that may refer to local events of the @(tsee encapsulate)
   that do not exist in the history after the transformation.
   </p>
   <p>
   This function is called iff
   the guards of the new function must be verified.

  "<p>
   This is a @(tsee progn) that starts with
   a (trivial) @(tsee encapsulate) that includes the events for
   the applicability conditions,
   the new function,
   the theorem that relates the old and new functions,
   and the recording of the generated numbered name.
   The @(tsee encapsulate) is followed by events
   for the recording in the transformation table
   and for the screen outputs.
   </p>
   <p>
   The @(tsee encapsulate) starts with some implicitly local event forms to
   ensure logic mode and
   avoid errors due to ignored or irrelevant formals in the generated function.
   Other implicitly local event forms remove any default and override hints,
   to improve the robustness of the generated proofs;
   this is done after proving the applicability conditions,
   in case their proofs rely on the default or override hints.
   </p>
   <p>
   The applicability condition theorems
   are all local to the @(tsee encapsulate),
   have no rule classes,
   and are enabled (they must be, because they have no rule classes).
   </p>
   <p>
   The @(tsee encapsulate) also includes events
   to locally install the non-normalized definitions
   of the old and new functions,
   because the generated proofs are based on the unnormalized bodies.
   </p>
   <p>
   As explained in @(tsee restrict-new-fn-intro-events)
   and @(tsee restrict-old-to-new-intro-events),
   the events for the new function
   and for the theorem that relates the old and new functions
   are introduced locally first, then redundantly non-locally
   (with slight variations).
   As explained in @(tsee restrict-new-fn-verify-guards-event),
   if the guards of the new function must be verified,
   the event to verify them is generated
   after the theorem that relates the old and new functions.
   </p>
   <p>
   The @(tsee progn) ends with an event form to print nothing on screen,
   because it already includes events
   to print the exported function and theorem events on screen.
   These exported events are printed on screen without hints;
   they are the same event forms
   that are introduced non-locally and redundantly in the @(tsee encapsulate).
   </p>
   <p>
   The @(tsee encapsulate) is stored into the transformation table,
   associated to the call to the transformation
   (without @(':verbose') and @(':show-only'), if any,
   because they only affect the transformation's screen output).
   Thus, the table event and the screen output events
   (which are in the @(tsee progn) but not in the @(tsee encapsulate))
   are not stored into the transformation table,
   because they carry no additional information
   (and because otherwise the table event would have to contain itself).
   </p>
   <p>
   If @(':show-only') is @('t'),
   the @(tsee encapsulate) is quoted and returned as a value triple.
   Thus, when this value triple is submitted as an event,
   the @(tsee encapsulate) is just shown on screen.
   The table event and the screen output events are excluded from this
   because they just &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; things that are already present
   in the @(tsee encapsulate) that is shown on the screen.
   </p>
   <p>
   To ensure the absence of name conflicts inside the @(tsee encapsulate),
   the event names to avoid are accumulated
   and threaded through the event-generating code.
