; It is necessary to evaluate the definition of all constants defined
; in vw-eval-fns.lisp before we certify vw-eval.lisp, because all the
; forms in vw-eval.lisp are read before any of them is evaluated --
; and the value of constants must be known before attempting to read
; the form #.<constant> .  We accomplish this here by having this
; little .acl2 file to load before certifying vw-eval; note that
; cert.pl loads this .acl2 file automatically in that case.
