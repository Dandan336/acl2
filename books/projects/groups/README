This directory contains an initial ACL2 formalization of elementary finite group theory, consisting of the following books:

* lists: a collection of results pertaining to list processing that were required in the development of the theory

* groups: groups and subgroups, the macros defgroup and defsubgroup, and some examples

* quotients: left cosets, Lagrange's Theorem, normal subgroupss, quotient groups

* cauchy: Cauchy's Theorem (If the order of a group g is divisible by prime p, then g has a subgroup of order p)

* symmetric: permutations, symmetric groups, tranpositions, parity of a permutation, alternating groups

* actions: group actions, the defaction macro, conjugate subgroups

* sylow: lifting a subgroup of a quotient group, p-groups and maximal p-subgroups, Sylow theorems
