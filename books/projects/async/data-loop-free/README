Book Certification
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To certify books, execute the following:

make ACL2=<Path of the ACL2 image>

To remove certificate files, etc., execute the following:

make clean ACL2=<Path of the ACL2 image>

See Makefile file for the detail.

The DE simulator is implemented in de.lisp.

The modeling and verification of data-loop-free self-timed circuits
are implemented in the following files:

* queue2.lisp: a queue of 2 links, Q2

* queue3.lisp: a queue of 3 links, Q3

* queue4-as-link.lisp: a queue of 4 links, Q4'. It is designed as a
  complex link.

* queue5-as-link.lisp: a queue of 5 links, Q5'. It is designed as a
  complex link.

* queue8-as-link.lisp: a queue of 8 links, Q8'. It is designed as a
  complex link.

* queue10-as-link.lisp: a queue of 10 links, Q10'. It is designed as a
  complex link.

* comp-v-or.lisp: a circuit performing the bitwise OR operation, C. It
  contains Q2 and Q3 as submodules.

* wig-wag.lisp: a wig-wag circuit, WW

* round-robin1.lisp: a round-robin circuit, RR1. It contains Q2 and Q3
  as submodules.

* round-robin2.lisp: a round-robin circuit, RR2. It contains Q4' and
  Q5' as submodules.

* round-robin3.lisp: a round-robin circuit, RR3. It contains Q8' and
  Q10' as submodules.
