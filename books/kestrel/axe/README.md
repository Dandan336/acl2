The Axe Toolkit
===============================

This directory contains Kestrel's Axe toolkit, which we are currently
open sourcing.  A basic set of functionality is already present here,
and we plan to open source more of the toolkit as needed.

The main tools of interest may be rewriter-basic.lisp and
prover-basic.lisp.

For more information, see the [Axe Webpage][Axe].
