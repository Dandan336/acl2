  (xdoc::p
   "This tutorial is work in progress,
    but it may be already useful in its current incomplete form.
    This tutorial's goal is to provide user-level information
    on how ATC works and how to use ATC effectively.
    See "
   (xdoc::seetopic "atc" "the ATC manual page")
   " for the ATC reference documentation.")

  (atc-tutorial-section "Structure of the Tutorial")

  (xdoc::p
   "This tutorial consists of this top-level page
    plus a number of hyperlinked pages,
    all of which are subtopics of this top-level page,
    listed below alphabetically for easy reference.
    Starting from this top-level page, we provide <i>Next</i> links
    to navigate sequentially through all the tutorial pages
    (and we also provide <i>Previous</i> links going the opposite direction).
    It is recommended to follow this order
    when reading this tutorial for the first time.")

  (xdoc::p
   "Each page starts with a short description of the contents of the page,
    and also says whether the page may be perhaps skipped at first reading,
    because it contains additional information
    that may not be necessary for a user to know in order to use ATC.
    However, it is recommended to read all the tutorial pages, eventually."))

(def-atc-tutorial-page motivation

  "Motivation for Generating C Code from ACL2"

  (xdoc::p
   "This tutorial page provides motivation for ATC.
    It may be skipped at first reading,
    especially if the reader is already motivated
    to generate C code from ACL2.")

  (xdoc::p
   "The motivation for generating C code from ACL2 is analogous to
    the motivation for generating Java code from ACL2,
    or for generating code in other programming language from ACL2.
    The @(see java::atj-tutorial-motivation) page
    provides the general motivation,
    in the context of Java:
    it is recommended to read that page.")

  (xdoc::p
   "In addition, as a specific motivation for generating C code,
    it should be noted that C is widely used in certain domains,
    such as embedded systems.
    Some of these C applications are relatively small in size
    and have strong safety and security requirements,
    making them an attractive target for (ACL2-based) formal methods."))

  "Comparison with ATJ's Java code generation from ACL2"

  (xdoc::p
   "ATC is related to "
   (xdoc::seetopic "java::atj" "ATJ")
   ", the Java code generator for ACL2.
    Aside from the obvious difference in target languages,
    ATJ and ATC currently differ in their primary goals and emphases.")

  (xdoc::p
   "ATJ was built to recognize, and translate to reasonable Java,
    essentially any ACL2 code
    (provided that it has side effects known to ATJ).
    ATJ also provides ways to exert finer-grained control
    on the generated Java,
    by using certain ACL2 types and operations
    that represent Java types and operations
    and that are translated to the corresponding Java constructs.
    While there are plans to have ATJ generate ACL2 proofs
    of the correctness of the generated code,
    ATJ currently does not generate proofs.")

  (xdoc::p
   "In contrast, ATC is being built to recognize, and translate to C,
    only certain ACL2 types and operations
    that represent C types and operations
    and that are translated to the corresponding Java constructs.
    ATC does not attempt to translate arbitrary ACL2 to C.
    From the outset, ATC also generates ACL2 proofs
    of the correctness of the generated C code.")

  (xdoc::p
   "The fact that ATC is much simpler than ATJ
    facilitates the generation of proofs.
    Generating proofs for ATJ is a larger task,
    due to the greater complexity.")

  (xdoc::p
   "In the future, ATC may be extended towards
    recognizing any ACL2 code and translating it to reasonable C,
    analogously to ATJ;
    but the plan is for ATC to always generate proofs.
    Conversely, ATJ may be extended to generate proofs as well.
    Thus, while eventually ATJ and ATC may provide similar features,
    their starting points and tradeoffs are different,
    which will keep the two tools different for some time to come."))

(def-atc-tutorial-page approach

  "Approach to Generating C Code from ACL2"

  (xdoc::p
   "ATC translates a subset of ACL2 to C.
    The ACL2 subset is designed to be close to C,
    i.e. to be essentially ``C written in ACL2'',
    so that it is easy to translate to C.
    There is a direct translation to the C constructs
    from their representation in ACL2.")

  (xdoc::p
   "ATC is meant to be used in conjunction with "
   (xdoc::seetopic "apt::apt" "APT")
   ". One uses APT transformations
    to refine ACL2 specifications and code
    to the subset recognized by ATC, which ATC translates to C.
    Thus, ATC can be used at the end of an APT derivation.")

  (xdoc::p
   "Currently ATC recognizes a very limited subset of ACL2
    and translates it to a very limited subset of C.
    This is just a first step (the development of ATC has just started);
    we plan to extend ATC to increasingly larger subsets of ACL2 and C."))
